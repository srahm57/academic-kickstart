I am tempted to call this blog a journey, but my experience with myself refrains me from doing so. I am a devout developer (from the past 2 years). I often tell myself that I love Machine Learning! That's because I hate probability and differential calculus. I will be completely honest in my blog. I don't care whoever you are. I hated number theory too. I am not an enemy of linear algebra though. Thanks to Somnath sir, Rajan sir, Saifi sir... and Gilbert ofcourse!

Still survived my Machine Learning course in BITS and also did research for a year under one of the best profs in my campus. I went to his lecture on the Fundamentals of Data Science at 8am twice a week despite not being allowed enrol in it! I read most of the chapters from Bishop's <i>"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"</i> book. Heck, it is beautiful! And it took some lectures from mitopencourseware to help me through my hatred of the fundamentals.<br>
Diligence is my thing. I am patient and persistant. Like a good donkey. Yes, I am quite self aware. To the point that I even hurt my confidence. I need to work on that. I think I took this quote way too seriously. 
> When the going get tough...

<br>Hence, this blog. 
<br>In this blog, I will just post whatever I learn. Very rarely, my opinions too. Please comment and guide me if I go the wrong way. I have taken many wrong turns and lost few good stuff in life. So, I am banking on you for the advice. Request you to not be unkind here. I get hurt fast.
